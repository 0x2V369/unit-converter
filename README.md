# Unit Converter

This project is a simple Unit Converter application built with Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to convert distances between kilometers and miles.

## Features

- **Conversion Options**: Users can choose between converting from kilometers to miles or from miles to kilometers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program provides an intuitive interface with labels that dynamically update based on the user's choice.
- **Real-Time Conversion**: The conversion result is displayed immediately after the user inputs a value and clicks "Convert."
- **Error Handling**: The program handles invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring the user experience is smooth and error-free.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Conversion**: Select either "km -> miles" or "miles -> km" from the listbox.
2. **Input Value**: Enter the distance you wish to convert.
3. **Convert**: Press the "Convert" button to see the converted value.

## Setup and Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- **Tkinter**: This program uses the Tkinter library, which comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

To run the program, simply clone the repository and execute the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x2V369/unit-converter.git
cd unit-converter
python3 unit_converter.py
```

## Customization

The conversion factors, window size, and labels can be easily customized within the script to suit other unit conversions or UI preferences.
